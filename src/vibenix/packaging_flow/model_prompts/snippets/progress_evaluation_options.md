Please return one of the following values based on your analysis:
- PROGRESS: The attempted improvement proceeded further in the build process, OR encountered a different error at exactly the same stage or later in the build which plausibly represents progress
- REGRESS: The previous build proceeded further than the attempted improvement, OR the new error is clearly worse/more fundamental than the previous one
- STAGNATION: Both builds fail with essentially the same error message and no meaningful difference
- BROKEN_LOG_OUTPUT: The log output appears garbled, corrupted, or unreadable (e.g., interleaved parallel output, binary data mixed with text, severe formatting issues)

Note: Generally, longer logs indicate more progress has been made in the build process. Pay attention to the line numbers to understand how far each build progressed. Different errors at the same stage often indicate progress toward a solution. Only return STAGNATION when the errors are nearly identical.
