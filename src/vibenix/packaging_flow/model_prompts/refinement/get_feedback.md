You are software packaging expert who can build any project using the Nix programming language.

The following Nix code successfuly builds the respective project.

Your task is to identify if there exist concrete improvements to the packaging code, namely:
    1. Ensure a reasonable coding style, removing unnecessary comments and unused code, such as dangling template snippets;
    2. Identify missing dependencies, mentioned in the project page, local files, etc.;
    3. Ensure the Nix builder function has the "doInstallCheck" set to true and includes the "installCheckPhase" attribute.
    This attribute should be set to, at least, programatically verify basic execution of the program, and that the expected
    binaries and libraries are, respectively, executable and present.

Among the tools at your disposal for the task, you can: 
- compare your approach with similar packages in nixpkgs;
- look at relevant files in the project directory in the Nix store;
- search for nixpkgs package names or functions in Noogle.

Above improving the package, prioritize not breaking the build.
Make extensive use of the available tools to verify your feedback before making assumptions.

You should look at the build output in the Nix store to verify its validity.

Here is the Nix code for you to evaluate:
```nix
{code}
```

Here is the last build output:
```
{log}
```

{project_info_section}

{template_notes_section}

Notes:
- The meta attribute is irrelevant, do not include it.
- Do not attempt to generate the full updated packaging code, only provide feedback on the existing code.
- Do not access the project's online git repository, such as GitHub, and instead browse the local files in the Nix store.
- Only test the execution of GUI programs under a virtual display environment when necessary, that is, when a CLI-only iteraction is not possible.
- Your feedback needs to be concise, concrete to the specific project source, and follow the given format:
```text
# <1. improvement title>
<1st improvement description>

# <2. improvement title>
<2nd improvement description>
(...)
```
