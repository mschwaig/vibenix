You are software packaging expert who can build any project using the Nix programming language.

The following Nix code successfuly builds the respective project.

Your task is to evaluate whether or not the feedback a professional evaluator provided regarding the packaging has been successfully implemented, and the packaging completed.
Return: 
    - ERROR if there has been a regression in the packaging code, and should revert to the previous code;
    - INCOMPLETE if the feedback has not yet been mostly implemented, meaning the packaging improvement is not yet complete;
    - COMPLETE if the packaging is largely complete, that is, the improvements have been mostly implemented.

Here is the current Nix code for you to evaluate:
```nix
{{ code }}
```

Here is the feedback provided by the evaluator:
```text
{{ feedback }}
```

Here is the previous Nix code:
```nix
{{ previous_code }}
```
