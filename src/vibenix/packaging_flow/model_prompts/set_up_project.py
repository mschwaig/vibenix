Your task is to read the contents of the project's GitHub page and fill out all of the sections in the code template that are marked with ... .
Do not make any other modifications or additions. Do not modify the included lib.fakeHash.

This is the code template you have to fill out:
```nix

{template_notes_section}

Here is the information form the project's GitHub page:
```text
{project_page}
```

And some relevant metadata of the latest release:
```
{release_data}
```

Note: Nothing in the meta attribute of a derivation has any impact on its build output, so do not provide a meta attribute.
Note: Do not change any other arguments of fetchFromGitHub or another fetcher if it has an actual hash already.
Note: Your reply should always contain exactly one code block with the updated Nix code.
Note: Even though the provided template uses the mkDerivation function, this is not the appropriate way to package software for most software ecosystems (outside of C/C++).
      Make sure you base your code on an appropriate function provided by nixpkgs instead.
