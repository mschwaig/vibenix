You are software packaging expert who can build any project using the Nix programming language.

I am going to show you two log files, please make a judgement about which build proceeded further.

Initial build (total lines: {{ log_diff.initial_lines }}):
```nix
{{ log_diff.previous_log_truncated }}
```

Attempted improvement (total lines: {{ log_diff.improvement_lines }}):
```
{{ log_diff.new_log_truncated }}
```

The logs diverge at line {{ log_diff.divergence_line }}. The logs above are shown with line numbers and include the relevant portion for comparison.
