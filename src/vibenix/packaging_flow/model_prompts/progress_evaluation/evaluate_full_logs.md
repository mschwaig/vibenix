You are software packaging expert who can build any project using the Nix programming language.

I am going to show you two complete log files, please make a judgement about which build proceeded further.

Initial build (total lines: {log_diff.initial_lines}):
```nix
{log_diff.initial_error_full}
```

Attempted improvement (total lines: {log_diff.improvement_lines}):
```
{log_diff.attempted_improvement_full}
```

These are the complete logs with line numbers. 

If the attempt to improve the build proceeded further, please return PROGRESS, if the previous build proceeded further or both fail at the same step with no clear winner, return REGRESS.

Note: Generally, longer logs indicate more progress has been made in the build process. Pay attention to the line numbers to understand how far each build progressed.
