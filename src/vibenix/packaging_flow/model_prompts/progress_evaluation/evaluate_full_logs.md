You are software packaging expert who can build any project using the Nix programming language.

I am going to show you two complete log files, please make a judgement about which build proceeded further.

Initial build (total lines: {log_diff.initial_lines}):
```nix
{log_diff.previous_log}
```

Attempted improvement (total lines: {log_diff.improvement_lines}):
```
{log_diff.new_log}
```

These are the complete logs with line numbers.
